# ESP32-Controlled Robotic Arm

This project demonstrates how to control a robotic arm using an ESP32 microcontroller, servo motors, and a mobile phone. The ESP32 creates a Wi-Fi hotspot, which the user can connect to on their mobile device. Once connected, the robotic arm can be controlled through a web page interface hosted on the ESP32, allowing for easy and convenient control of the arm via buttons.

## Features
- Control a robotic arm with servos using an ESP32 microcontroller.
- Mobile phone connectivity via Wi-Fi hotspot created by the ESP32.
- Simple web-based interface to control arm movements using buttons.

## How It Works
1. The ESP32 is programmed to create a Wi-Fi hotspot.
2. Connect your mobile device to the Wi-Fi network generated by the ESP32.
3. Open a web browser on your mobile device and navigate to `192.168.4.1`.
4. A webpage will open, providing buttons for controlling the robotic arm.

## Components
- **ESP32 microcontroller**
- **Servo motors** for controlling the robotic arm's movement
- **Mobile device** with Wi-Fi connectivity

## Setup and Installation
### Hardware Connections
1. Connect the servo motors to the ESP32's GPIO pins.
2. Power the ESP32 with a USB cable or an external power source.
3. Ensure the servos have adequate power from the ESP32 or an external power supply.

### Software Installation
1. Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) if you haven't already.
2. Install the ESP32 board libraries in the Arduino IDE.
3. Go to sketch option in arduino IDE and select include libries and add the zip file provided in github (AsyncTCP-master),(ESPAsyncWebServer-master)
